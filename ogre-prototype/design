4 canvas
	* bg canvas : tile layer 
		- lowest z-index
	* st canvas : stationary layer 
		- holds stationary objects such as resources and cities / castles
	* main canvas : main layer
		- holds the units and any other things that move about the map
	* fg canvas : fg layer
		- optional - paralax, clouds, etc



main tick : the tick function
	both server and client
	needs to be at top-level
	
core.engine

	init	
		#server
			set up map / read map file
			initialize resource nodes
			initialize cities / castles
			initialize game properties
				* time	[used to calculate day/night and calendar]
				* in-game calendar
				
		
		#client
			set up map from server input
			initialize resource nodes from server input
			initialize cities / castles from server input
	
	tick
		#called from main tick
		call update functions
		
		#client
		update unit positions
		call draw function
		
	handle_input_request
	
	
Server should run the full engine code
Client should be only display and a lite version of the engine
We want the server to be the authority and send info to all clients about the game
